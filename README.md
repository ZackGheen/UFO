#**Overview**

##Technologies used

**JavaScript ES6+** and **HTML** to write background code in VS Code editor.
**GitPages** and local server to display and host dynamic webpage.

The overall goal of this analysis is for us to build a webpage that has a dynamic table which will provide in-depth analysis of UFO Sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria(/s) at the same time.

The criteria that can the webpage can filter by are the following:

- **Date**
- **City**
- **State**
- **Country**
- **Shape**

#**Results of Analysis**

Two perform a search using one of the five criteria above do as follows:

##**Step 1**

start by inputting data into the filters of the website's **"Filter Search Box"**.

Any combination of different filters can be used so that anybody can search any country, or time that they like. We can even search by shapes of UFOs sighted!

For example let's say I wanted to search for a triangle ship in Pasadena California on 1/1/2010; this is a very specific search but we can do that!

And just like that we have a hit! this gives our users many different opportunities to find out where and when, UFOs are being spotted. 

#**Summary**

Drawback - The user doesnt have a ready list of city names where UFO have been sighted, so when a city name is typed, say for instance they add Kansas City, nothing populates. Maybe the filter can have a drop down menu function rather, which will list the names of the cities where UFO have been sighted.  Additionally, the table can also contain another column with a link to the article or an image box, to make it more insightful experience. I also think it would be benficial to use a different background for the list of events and perhaps collapse them into a page slection format instead of having them all on one page.
